### About Me ###
I am a UK CompSci student looking to document my learning experience, projects and passions. With a background primarily in OOP, Java, C# and Python I have developed a number of high-level programming projects. This includes desktop apps, web apps and console apps, which have been completed with a variety of development methodologies including AGILE, pair-programming and individual projects. I've also studied a wider range of topics including database design, AI and security.

### Future Directions: ###
Recently I've become more interested in embedded systems design, development and security. So I'm shifting my focus to low-level programming languages (C\C++ currently) and computer architecture as well as completing CTFs (primarily pwnable and reverse engineering). I am also interested in clean coding and further improving the readability, efficiency and usability of my code which is, of course, highly beneficial in embedded systems development. To achieve this I will further study data structures and algorithms, and more critically study relevant and widely recognised projects, which I believe will give my projects more value/relevance.

### Motivation: ###
I've seen and been a part of projects that feel bloated or shallow - relying on existing libraries while adding little value. This is, in my opinion, not only ugly but costly and I believe learning embedded will steer me away from this kind of development. Embedded systems are a bridge between computation and the outside world, they are used in industrial control equipment, cars, air traffic control, medical devices, agriculture, disaster response, space exploration. It can be used in humanitarian efforts by providing power-efficient computation in areas with little infrastructure to support bloated systems. Embedded systems provide direct, real value and they do it efficiently. 
Im also motivated by my own passion for the subject. You provide an arrangement of conductors and semi-conductors (perhaps a little crystal) with a power source and a community of similarly passionate individuals and you can look through the eyes of a robot digging through dirt on mars.
